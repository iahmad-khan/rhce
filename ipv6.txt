IPv6
----

You can activate ipv6 privacy extensions:

    # vim /etc/sysctl.conf
    # sysctl -p
    net.ipv6.conf.enp0s3.use_tempaddr = 2

This will cause the autogenerated ipv6 address to be randomized and renewed every 24 hours.

You can disable ipv6 like this:

    # vim /etc/sysctl.conf
    # sysctl -p
    net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1 
    net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6=1

Question: what is the difference in /proc/sys/net/ipvX/conf/ between "all" and "default"?
