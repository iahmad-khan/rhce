Installing Software
-------------------

Software is installed using yum. It might be worth installing +yum-utils+, which 
enhances yums capablities.

If you would like to have a persistent cache of the metadata, you can tell yum to 
keep the cache by setting

    keepcache=1

in +/etc/yum.conf+. After that you should clean and rebuild the cache:

    yum clean all 
    yum makecache

Then you might want to have a cron job which keeps your cache up to date (e.g. +yum-updatesd+).
