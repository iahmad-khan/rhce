NTP
---

There are two tools to synchronize time over network: the classic ntp, and the new chrony.

ntpdate and ntpd
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to manually synchronize the time, you can issue something like

    ntpdate time.server.org

where +time.server.org+ should be replaced with the fqdn of a real time server.
You can also start the service +ntpd+, which will then periodically synchronize time.
The downside of this is that ntpd can not correct bigger time differences.

Time servers for ntpd are configured in +/etc/ntp.conf+, where a lot of examples
are configured, so the syntax should be clear.

chrony
~~~~~~
The newer chrony, part of systemd, is configured via +/etc/chrony.conf+. There you
can define your time servers, the syntax is similar to ntpd - check the file for
examples.

chrony runs as a service called chronyd.
