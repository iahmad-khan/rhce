Preface
-------

These are notes I took during preparation for the RHCE exam. I followed the RHCE book by Markus Frei, and also read some of the official
Redhat documentation. I have omited topics that I felt comfortable with already, so this is by no means a complete study guide.

To actually try out things I had two virtual boxes with centos 7.0 installed.
