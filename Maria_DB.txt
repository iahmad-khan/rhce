Maria DB
--------

After installing +mariadb-server+, start the service +mariadb+, and enable it it the firewall. 
In the firewall it is called +mysql+, because Maria DB is a fork of MySQL.

You can connect to the database locally with

    mysql -u root

Securing the root Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The default installatin does not have a password for the local root user. For security reasons,
this should be changed. Also, there is more then one root account - accounts have not only
a username, but also a hostpart from where the user connects, so e.g. root@'127.0.0.1' and
root@'rhce1' are two different accounts, which each can have their own password. 

Then there is an guest accout accessible to everyone, intended for testing, and a test
database accessible to everyone, also for testing. These should be removed for production use.

This can all be done using sql commands, but is a bit tedious, so there is a script
provided which will guide you through all the steps and does the updates to the mariadb for you:

    mysql_secure_installation

This script can also restrict root access from localhost only.

One could go further to rename the root account


Adding sample data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is an official sample database, also used for trainings. It is publicly available:

    wget http://downloads.mysql.com/docs/world_innodb.sql.gz

Firt we need to create the database:

    mysql -u root -p 
    > create database world;
    > exit;

Then we load the unzipped data into that database:

    mysql -u root -p world  </tmp/world_innodb.sql


Navigating a database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note the syntax: +mysql -u <username> -p <databasename>+. The +-p+ specifies to ask for a password, 
alternativly you could also give the password on the commandline: +--password=xxxxx+, which is
less favorable form a security standpoint.

Now login again as root

    mysql -u root -p

and see which databases we have:

    > show databases;

select a database and see which tables it has:

    > use world;
    > show tables;

Creating users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Depending on the setup, it can be good practise to create at least two users per database. One that can only
read, and one that can also write and create new tables:

    > grant all on world.* to 'world-admin'@'10.23.23.%' identified by 'xxxxx';
    > grant select on world.* to 'world-user'@'10.23.23.%' identified by 'xxxxx';
    > flush privileges;

Note the use of the wildcarc +%+ in the host identifier - this allows access from the whole subnet.
The "flush" command forces mariadb to reread the privileges database.

CRUD
~~~~
CRUD is an abreviation for "Create Read Update Delete", which are common actions performed on a database.
A Read in MariaDB is done using the "select" statemente, e.g.:

    mysql -u world-user -p -h rhce1
    use world;
    select Name from world where CountryCode='deu';
    select * from world where CountryCode='deu';
    select Name,CountryCode,Population from City where Name like '%ingen%';
    select Name,CountryCode,Population from City where 1 order by Population desc limit 3;
    select count(*), 'Citys in Germany' from City where CountryCode='deu';
    select count(*) as cnt, District from City where CountryCode='deu' group by District \
        order by cnt desc;

Create/Insert:

    insert into City (Name,District,CountryCode,Population) values ('Schoenau', \
        'Baden Wuertemberg', 'deu', '2000');
    ERROR 1142 (42000): INSERT command denied to user 'world-user'@'rhce1.lcsys.ch' \
        for table 'City'
    mysql -u world-admin -p -h rhce1
    use world;
    insert into City (Name,District,CountryCode,Population) values ('Schoenau', \
       'Baden Wuertemberg', 'deu', '2000');
    
Update:

    MariaDB [world]> update City set Population = Population + 4 where Name='Schoenau';

Delete:

    delete from City where Name='Schoenau';

Complex Queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    select * from City left join Country on City.CountryCode = Country.Code \
        where City.Name = "ZÃ¼rich";

    select Country.Name from Country left join CountryLanguage on \
        Country.Code = CountryLanguage.CountryCode where \
        Language = "German" and IsOfficial = "T";
