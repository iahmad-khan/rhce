A good intrucution to managing teams with nmcli is given by

Teaming with nmcli
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a new team connection using roundrobin with the two interfaces enp0s9 and enp0s10:


    nmcli connection add type team con-name team0  ifname veteam0
    #nmcli connection modify team0 ipv4.addresses  "10.23.23.77/24 10.23.23.1 "
    nmcli connection modify team0 team.config roundrobin.conf
    [root@rhce1 ~]# cat roundrobin.conf
    {
            "device":               "team0",
            "runner":               {"name": "roundrobin"},
            "ports":                {"enp0s9": {}, "enp0s10": {}}
    }
    # add slave interfaces
    nmcli connection add type team-slave con-name team0-port0 ifname enp0s9 master team0
    nmcli connection add type team-slave con-name team0-port1 ifname enp0s10 master team0

Each slave interface needs to be configured with a seperate connection of type "team-slave".

The above works, but bringing team0 down and up again without a reboot does not work.  For some reason, when bringng team0 down, the devices it uses are disconnected. If you try to reconnect them first

    [root@rhce1 ~]# nmcli con down team0
    [root@rhce1 ~]# nmcli dev st
    DEVICE   TYPE      STATE         CONNECTION
    enp0s3   ethernet  connected     Wired connection 1
    enp0s8   ethernet  connected     hostonly
    enp0s10  ethernet  disconnected  --
    enp0s9   ethernet  disconnected  --
    lo       loopback  unmanaged     --
    [root@rhce1 ~]# nmcli dev connect enp0s9
    Error: Device activation failed: The device has no connections available.
    [root@rhce1 ~]# nmcli dev st
    DEVICE   TYPE      STATE         CONNECTION
    enp0s3   ethernet  connected     Wired connection 1
    enp0s8   ethernet  connected     hostonly
    enp0s10  ethernet  disconnected  --
    enp0s9   ethernet  unavailable   --
    lo       loopback  unmanaged     --
    [root@rhce1 ~]# nmcli dev connect enp0s10
    Device 'enp0s10' successfully activated with '1ad12cb7-767f-4886-b222-692560498b0d'.

    [root@rhce1 ~]# nmcli con up team0
    Connection successfully activated (D-Bus active path: /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/ActiveConnection/7)
    [root@rhce1 ~]# nmcli dev st
    DEVICE   TYPE      STATE        CONNECTION
    enp0s10  ethernet  connected    team0-port1
    enp0s3   ethernet  connected    Wired connection 1
    enp0s8   ethernet  connected    hostonly
    veteam0  team      connected    team0
    enp0s9   ethernet  unavailable  --
    lo       loopback  unmanaged    --

You can activate team0 again, but with just one interface.

Teaming with traditional ifcfg
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following traditional configuration works:

    [root@rhce1 network-scripts]# for i in ifcfg-enp0s* ifcfg-team0 ;do echo $i;echo ===========; cat $i;echo ;done
    ifcfg-enp0s10
    ===========
    DEVICE="enp0s10"
    ONBOOT="yes"
    DEVICETYPE="TeamPort"
    TEAM_MASTER="team0"

    ifcfg-enp0s9
    ===========
    DEVICE="enp0s9"
    ONBOOT="yes"
    DEVICETYPE="TeamPort"
    TEAM_MASTER="team0"

    ifcfg-team0
    ===========
    TEAM_MASTER="team0"
    DEVICE="team0"
    DEVICETYPE="Team"
    ONBOOT="yes"
    BOOTPROTO=none
    TEAM_CONFIG='{"runner": {"name": "roundrobin"}}'
    IPADDR=10.23.23.77
    GATEWAY=10.23.23.1

To active this, restart the networking service:

    systemctl restart network.service
