Postfix

master.cf
~~~~~~~~~

After installing the postfix package, you can find some default configuration files in +/etc/postfix+.
There is the +master.cf+, which controls the master process. For the scope of
what is expected for RHCE, I expect no modifications are needed to be made there.

main.cf
~~~~~~~
And then there is the +main.cf+, where
most of the configuration occurs. By default, the system can relay from local recepients to local
recepients.

You need to make sure the hostname is set correctly, with fqdn. If you want to relay mails from your
local network, check the following two parameters:

    mynetworks = 10.23.23.0/24, 127.0.0.1 # usually the default
    inet_interfaces = all

+mynetworks+ specifies a range of hosts, which are trusted automatically, which means that mails from
them will be accepted without any further checks.

+inet_interfaces+ specifies on which interfaces to listen to.

There are other parameters that need to be set, but most of them have good defaults, and in order to
do local mail delivery, everything is already set up.

Mailrelay
~~~~~~~~~
If postfix is not only to deliver to local mailboxes, but forward mails that it can not deliver localy, a mail realy needs
to be configured. This is done in +main.cf+ with the parameter

    relayhost = rhce1.acme.ch
    mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost, $mydomain

for example. After reloading postix, all mail that can not be delivered locally will be forwarded to relayhost.
Note that +mydestination+ needed the appendix of +$mydomain+, otherwise postfix would not accept
mails for other hosts in my domain.

Aliases
~~~~~~~
Basic alias configuration is done in

    /etc/aliases

which is a simple text file. It defines aliases for local mail delivery. Check the contents of the file - it is already populated with 
defaults. After you make changes to this file, it is important to issue

    newaliases

which reads the textfile and transforms it into a binary format (+/etc/aliases.db+),
which will then be read by postfix. This does not require a restart
of the postfix daemon.

Tools
~~~~~

To check the actual setting of a parameter, it is helpfull to use the +postconf+ utility, which by
default displays all parameters and their current setting. For example, to view the current +mynetworks+ setting,
type

    postconf |grep mynetworks

In order to do basic testing, it can be helpfull to know the basic smtp commands. Connect to port 25 of your mail
relay, then issue

    root@rhce1 ~]# telnet rhce2 25
    Trying 10.23.23.52...
    Connected to rhce2.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    220 rhce2.acme.ch ESMTP Postfix
    HELO rhce1.acme.ch
    250 rhce2.acme.ch
    MAIL FROM:isaac@acme.ch
    250 2.1.0 Ok
    RCPT TO:root@rhce2.acme.ch
    250 2.1.5 Ok
    DATA
    354 End data with <CR><LF>.<CR><LF>
    Hello root,

    how do you do?

    yours,
    Isaac
    .
    250 2.0.0 Ok: queued as AE62E90CAF8

The basic commands to remember are:

    HELO <fqdn local host>
    MAIL FROM:<sender mail address>
    RCPT TO:<recipient mail address>
    DATA 
    . # finish with period, followed by a blank line.

Each command is answered with a status code. 250 means "OK", 354 means "Start mail input; end with <CRLF>.<CRLF>".
Then, on rhce2, we are informed that mail was received:

    [root@rhce2 ~]#
    You have mail in /var/spool/mail/root
    [root@rhce2 ~]# cat /var/spool/mail/root
    From isaac@acme.ch  Wed Mar  4 01:06:38 2015
    Return-Path: <isaac@acme.ch>
    X-Original-To: root@rhce2.acme.ch
    Delivered-To: root@rhce2.acme.ch
    Received: from rhce1.acme.ch (rhce1 [10.23.23.51])
            by rhce2.acme.ch (Postfix) with SMTP id AE62E90CAF8
            for <root@rhce2.acme.ch>; Wed,  4 Mar 2015 01:05:54 -0500 (EST)

    Hello root,

    how do you do?

    yours,
    Isaac

So things are working. If not, check +/var/log/maillog+. Each mail gets its uniq ID, which is the last part of the conversation of
the mta with the client (+250 2.0.0 Ok: queued as AE62E90CAF8+). We can grep for that ID to see what happend with that email:

    [root@rhce2 ~]# grep AE62E90CAF8 /var/log/maillog
    Mar  4 01:06:18 rhce2 postfix/smtpd[2734]: AE62E90CAF8: client=rhce1[10.23.23.51]
    Mar  4 01:06:38 rhce2 postfix/cleanup[2737]: AE62E90CAF8: message-id=<>
    Mar  4 01:06:38 rhce2 postfix/qmgr[2705]: AE62E90CAF8: from=<isaac@acme.ch>, size=227, nrcpt=1 (queue active)
    Mar  4 01:06:38 rhce2 postfix/local[2738]: AE62E90CAF8: to=<root@rhce2.acme.ch>, relay=local, delay=44, delays=44/0.04/0/0.01, dsn=2.0.0, status=sent (delivered to mailbox)
    Mar  4 01:06:38 rhce2 postfix/qmgr[2705]: AE62E90CAF8: removed
    [root@rhce2 ~]#

In this case we see that themail was queued and delivered to mailbox.
