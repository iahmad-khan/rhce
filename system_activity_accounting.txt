System Activity Accounting
--------------------------

Various aspects of system activity (cpu, ram, device throughput, ...) can be monitored with +sar+.
+sar+ collects the data and writes it to daily binary reports under +/var/log/sa/+.

+sar+ is contained in the +sysstat+ package. Without any options, +sar+ displays cpu activity. Consult the man page
for the myriard of options available.

The frequency of measurement is controlled by the cronjob defined in +/etc/cron.d/sysstat+. Other parameters (e.g. how
many files to keep) are stored in +/etc/sysconfig/sysstat+.

Another tool contained in the +sysstat+ package is +iostat+. It can be called like this:

    iostat <intervall lenth in seconds> <number of interfalls to display>

E.g. 
    
    iostat 2 5

Without the number of intervalls, new data is displayed for ever.
