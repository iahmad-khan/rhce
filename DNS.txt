DNS
---

There are two packages for doing DNS that will be examined here: bind and unbound. 

Caching only name server with bind
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

bind is configured via +/etc/named.conf+. +named+ is also the name of the service. Details about the config can
be found with +man named.conf+. Also, the default config file lists quite a few options. For a caching name server,
the following directives are needed:

    listen-on port 53 {any;};   // any could also be a semicolon seperated list of ip addresses
    allow-query {localhost; 10.23.23.0/24 };
    recursion yes;
    forward only;
    forwarders {8.8.8.8; };

So here we define a DNS server that allows recursion ( which makes sense since it is caching only), and that forwards requests.
A list of DNS servers is defined which the queries are forwarded to (+forwarders+), we listen on port 53 on all interfaces,
and allow queries from localhost and the +10.23.23.0/24+ subnet. If everyone should be able to access the server, then the
+allow-query+ directive can be ommited.

Now bevor starting the servic,e we can check the config for syntax errors:

    named-checkconf

If that did not show any errors, we can start named.

You can get an answer from a specific server e.g. like this:

    dig @localhost www.google.com



Caching only name server with unbound
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

unbound is configured via +/etc/unbound/unbound.conf+. The default file is commented, so lots of options are already explained there.
A minimal caching only nameserer would be configured like this:

    server:
            interface: 0.0.0.0
            access-control: 10.23.23.0/24 allow
            domain-insecure: "example.com"
    remote-control:
            control-enable: yes
    forward-zone:
            name: "."
            forward-host: 8.8.8.8


The option +domain-insecure+ specifies domains where validation should be ommited. This might be interesting for local zones.

DNS-Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Maybe the best tool for dns troubleshooting is +dig+ (check +yum whatprovices dig+ for the package it is included with).

The order in which dns queries are done (local, dns server, ...) is defined in +/etc/nsswitch+, in the line that starts
with +hosts+. In order to check if your system is ok, you can compare the output of

    dig @yournameserver www.google.com
    getent hosts www.google.de

+getent+ respects +/etc/nsswitch+, so a difference in the output could hint to a problem with the local system.

You could also force dig to use tcp (if udp is somehow blocked):

    dig +tcp www.google.com
