Cheatsheet
----------

This is no intent to cheat, but rather a fictional cheat sheet. Here I write down bits and peaces that
I find hard to remember. By writing them down here, I remember them, so no need to cheat :).

Samba
~~~~~
Start both smb and nmb.

Mount options for multiuser mount: credentials=/root/credfile.txt,multiuser,sec=ntmlssp

Kerberized NFS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In +/etc/sysconfig/nfs+, set +RPCNFSDARGS="-V 4.2"+. This allows you to export SELinux contexts.

Mount options: defaults,sec=krb5p,v4.2
