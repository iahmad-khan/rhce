Samba
-----

Basics
~~~~~~

Install the samba server by installing the packages +samba+ and +samba-client+. This gives you a well documented
+/etc/samba/smb.conf+.

By default, it exports homedirs and printers. Make sure to read the section about SELinux at the top of the default
configuratin file. Then enable samba in the firewall, start the service and enable home dir sharing in SELinux:

    [root@rhce2 ~]# vim /etc/samba/smb.conf
    [root@rhce2 ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=samba
    success
    [root@rhce2 ~]# firewall-cmd --reload
    success
    [root@rhce2 ~]# systemctl start smb nmb
    [root@rhce2 ~]# setsebool -P samba_enable_home_dirs on

If you want to export a different direcory, you could for example use the provided +[public]+ share:

    # A publicly accessible directory that is read only, except for users in the
    # "staff" group (which have write permissions):
            [public]
            comment = Public Stuff
            path = /home/samba
            public = yes
            writable = yes
            printable = no
            write list = @staff

*Note that the samba users - which are mapped to system users - need to have permissions on the directories that we want to export.*
So if I have a systemuser +isaac+, I need to add that user also to samba (+smbpasswd -a isaac+), and then give read (and write) 
permission to isaac on the exported dir. This can be acomplished in different kinds of ways, either through classic filesystem
permissions, or with ACLs, which is much more flexible and probably what you want in this case.

If the samba share is owned by a specific group, it is advisable to give the SGID bit on the parent directory:

    chgrp staff /home/samba
    chmod 2775 /home/samba

To see all possible configuration items, use

    testparm -v

Without the +-v+, only currently set items are shown.


Mounting a samba share on a client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To mount a samba share on an client, you issue something like this:

    mount -t cifs //10.23.23.52/public /mnt/smb/ -o username=isaac,password=xxxxx

Note that this requires the package +cifs_utils+ (it provides mount.cifs). Also note that the syntax for
specfying a share is

    //<hostname or IP>/<share name>

where +<share name>+ is NOT the path on the server, but the name of the share, as specified in square brackets, see above.

If you want to mount remote samba shares as homedirs, you need to toggle the following SELinux boolean:

    setsebool -P use_samba_home_dirsi=on

This is not to be confused with +samba_enable_home_dirs+, which controls the exporting of homedrs.

Multiuser mounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To mount a share with multiuser functionality, user a fstab entry like this:

    //rhce1/sharename cifs credentials=/root/smbcred.txt,multiuser,sec=ntlmssp 0 0

Tools
~~~~~

You can get a listing of all samba users with

    pdbedit --list

There is a tool to edit the samba passwords:

    smbpasswd -a <username>

This will add a user to the local samba passwd file.
